How do I approach designing software?
  I approach designing software by first figuring out the scope of the project. I want to make sure that i have enough time to create everything i need so i also make sure that i create a rough outline of what i want my program to be able to do. This includes designs and some ideas of how the code will work together. I try to do as much as i can on paper before officially moving it over to being actual code. I think this is incredibly helpful for the future as it allows me to be able to give an accurately estimated time and be able to figure out the scope before hand before diving headfirst into a new project for a future client.
  
How do I approach developing programs?
  I approach developing programs slowly. It's not about trying to get a product out as fast as you can but rather the quality of the product be something that you are proud of releasing. Once all the code is figured out only then can you start writing it and debugging it. For the code i also try to debug everytime i get a function built to ensure that everything is working smoothly. You never know when something breaks the code and you don't want to have something like that happen after writing lines and lines and lines of code and not test it at all. 
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer science overall is a huge part of reaching my goals as i do want to become a programmer. I don't know entirely where i want to end up when it comes to being a programmer but i do think that this class is very helpful in achieving those goals. This class helped me alot with making sure i had the time to be able to get everything that i needed to done. I've always struggled with time which is why it is a huge part of my learning experience but i do fele this class really helped me alot in working with that.
